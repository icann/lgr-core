    - Assign test labels to already existing tests, e.g. "valid_unicode_version" and "metadata_language".
    - Add new labelled tests, e.g. tests for the "validity-start" and "validity-end" elements.
    - Add aggregation of test results in terms of successful test labels.
    - Add a method to calculate the validation result based on policy and test results.
    - Add an RFC 7940 validation tool.
