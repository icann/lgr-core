# Test Cases

This directory contains the test cases.

They are divided into two classes:
	* unit test cases, to validate small portion (specific functions, etc.) of the code.
	* functional test cases, to validate API in general.

## How to Run the Tests

The following command allows to run a single test module:

	$ PYTHONPATH=.. python3 unit/test_lgr_core.py

To run all tests, use the `runtest.sh` script located in the top directory.
