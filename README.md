# LGR Core library

Core library and LGR data structure used to manipulate an LGR.

This version conforms to the specification [RFC7940](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7940.txt).

## Virtual Environment setup

If your distribution does not package the required dependencies, the easiest way
to get a working environment in no-time is to use Python's virtual environments.

* Install [virtualenv](https://github.com/pypa/virtualenv)
* Create a python virtualenv:

		$ virtualenv venv

* Activate the environment:

		$ source ./venv/bin/activate

* Download dependencies:

		(venv) $ pip install -r requirements.txt

## Tools

The `tools` directory contains some tools to exercise the library.

* `xml_dump.py` parses an XML LGR file, creates the LGR structure, and convert
  it back to XML.
* `make_idna_repertoire.py` generates the IDNA2008 starting repertoire, by
  parsing the [IDNA2008 table registry](http://www.iana.org/assignments/idna-tables/idna-tables.xhtml)
  available on IANA website, and collecting all `PVALID`, `CONTEXTO` and `CONTEXTJ` characters.
* `lgr_cli.py` parsed an XML LGR file, and validate it against configured MSR
  and Unicode version.
* `rfcXXXX_dump.py` parses inputs in RFC XXXX format, and generate an XML LGR.
* `one_per_line_dump.py` parses input in the "one per line" format, and generate an XML LGR.

Other tools are available to manipulate LGR files and labels:
* `lgr_annotate.py` takes an LGR and a list of labels and output
  the list of labels with their respective disposition.
* `lgr_collision.py` takes an LGR and a list of labels and check
  for collision(s) between the labels/variants.
* `lgr_compare.py` is used to compare 2 LGR (output textual diff, merge, intersection).
* `lgr_diff_collision.py` takes 2 LGR and one set of labels,
  and test for collisions between labels and generated variants from the 2 LGR.
* `lgr_merge_set.py` takes some LGRs and create a merged LGR from the provided set.

## Testing and coverage

Tests and coverage report can be run as follows:

	(venv) $ ./runtests.sh

Open `cover/index.html` in a web browser for the coverage report.

## Documentation

To generate the documentation, go to the `doc` directory and run the following command:

    (venv) $ make html

The generated documentation is available in `doc/_build/html/index.html`.
